# Intro:

I made this project with Oskar Kowal√≥w to makes repeatedly work stupid-easy. 

**For localhost test**, copy-paste all `.tgz` into `./lib` and change path in package.json.

## Storybooks

Each Storybook requires to be installed separately by:

```shell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run start
```

`--legacy-peer-deps` is required for Vue2 and Angular11
